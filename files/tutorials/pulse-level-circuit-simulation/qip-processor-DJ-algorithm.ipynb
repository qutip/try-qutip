    "In this example, we demonstrate how to simulate simple quantum algorithms on a qauntum hardware with QuTiP. The simulators are defined in the class `Processor`(and its sub-classes). `Processor` represents a general quantum device. The interaction of the quantum systems such as qubits is defined by the control Hamiltonian. For a general introduction of pulse-level simulation, please refer to [the user guide](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/qip-processor.html).\n",

    "## The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm\n",
    "The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm is the simplest quantum algorithm that offers an exponential speed-up compared to the classical one. It assumes that we have a function $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ which is either balanced or constant. Constant means that $f(x)$ is either 1 or 0 for all inputs while balanced means that $f(x)$ is 1 for half of the input domain and 0 for the other half. A more rigorous definition can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch-Jozsa_algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm includes $n$ input qubits and 1 ancilla initialised in state $1$. At the end of the algorithm, the first $n$ qubits are measured on the computational basis. If the function is constant, the result will be $0$ for all $n$ qubits. If balanced, $\\left|00...0\\right\\rangle$ will never be measured.\n",
    "The following example is implemented for the balanced function $f:\\{00,01,10,11\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, where $f(00)=f(11)=0$ and $f(01)=f(10)=1$. This function is balanced, so the probability of measuring state $\\left|00\\right\\rangle$ should be 0."
