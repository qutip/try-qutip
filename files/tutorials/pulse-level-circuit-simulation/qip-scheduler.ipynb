    "# Scheduler for quantum gates and instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Boxi Li (etamin1201@gmail.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite coherence time of physical qubits is one of the major factors that limits the performance of quantum computation. In principle, the execution time of the circuit has to be much shorter than the coherence time. One way to reduce this execution time is to run several gates in the circuit parallelly. This can spare a lot of time if e.g. the same single-qubit gate is applied to all qubits, as in the [Grover algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "A scheduler for a quantum computer, similar to its classical counterpart, schedules a quantum circuit to minimize the execution time. It determines the order in which the gates are executed. As a simple rule, the scheduler allows gates to be executed in parallel if they do not address the same qubits. Further hardware constraints can be included, but here we only focus on this simple criterion by considering gates that do not address the same qubits. The non-trivial part of a scheduler is that it has to consider the possible permutations of commuting quantum gates. Hence, exploring various possibilities for permutation while following physical constraints of the hardware is the main challenging task for the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first show how we can schedule gate execution in quantum circuits using the built-in tools in `qutip_qip` and then the scheduling of compiled control pulses. In the end, we also show a simple example where the permutation of commuting gates matters in the scheduling and how to handle such situations."
